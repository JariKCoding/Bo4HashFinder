Bo4HashFinder is a tool that allows you to find the official names of animations and models from Black Ops 4.
If a match is found, it will be dumped to a .txt file for you to add into your greyhound/wraith.

## Using Bo4HashFinder
There are 4 modes in the program:

* 1-2 - Brute force a small part of a string (Good for finding animation/model variants)
* 3 - Looks for all animations and models for that specific internal weapon name.
* 4 - Looks into the model and anim folder of greyhound and checks if there is an asset with that name.
